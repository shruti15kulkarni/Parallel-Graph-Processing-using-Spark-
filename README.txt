ReadReplace. java - this program was used to clean and normalize the latin text file, as we are new to scala and could not figure out the syntactical details to do it in scala. 
ngram.scala - This file finds the bigrams of every line in the text, and gives its corresponding location. 

Output format: word1, word2, location.
We have tested it on multiple documents varying it from 2grams to ngrams.
